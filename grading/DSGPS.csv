/,COMPILATION,1 (YES ) or 0 (NO),,
1,The code compiled from the first try.,1,2,
2,"NOTE: skip this question if question 1 answer was ""Yes"": The code did no compile initially, but was fixed with minor corrections / changes.",,1,
/,APP FUNCTIONALITY,,,
3,"The app asks for activity tracking permission (NOTE: it should ask either immediately when opened, or when a user tries to start the Service).",1,1,
4,"The app shows a drawer layout with the dasboard, history, and settings options in the menu.",1,1,
5,The landing screen (the first screen displayed to the user) shows the dashboard fragment.,1,1,
6,"The first time it is opened, the dashboard fragment and the history fragment do not contain any data about the userâ€™s physical activity.",1,1,
7,"The settings fragment has options to set the step count goal, the notification time setting (i.e. at what time of the user should be notified about not reaching their step count goal), and the option to  reset the app.",1,2,
8,The settings fragment has options to start tracking (on/off).,1,1,
9,Clicking on the start tracking option shows a notification in the notification bar.,1,2,
10,Clicking on the notification navigates the user to the dashboard screen.,1,2,
11,"If you exit the app with the tracking service on, the notification is still shown.",1,2,
/,APP TESTING,,,
12,"Copy the test class from Ucilnica (FullActivityTransitionSequenceTest.kt) in androidTest folder and run the test. The test requires you to interact with the emulator, e.g. give premissions if asked. Also, at the end of the test you have 30 seconds to pull down the notification bar and check notifications. Does the notification show that the current activity is "walking"?",1,3,
13,"Modify the test class so that the acitivity is "running".  The test requires you to interact with the emulator, e.g. give premissions if asked. Also, at the end of the test you have 30 seconds open extended emulator control, go to virtual sensors - device pose, and move/rotate the emulator to simulate device acceleration. Does the dashboard fragment show the acceleration intensity?",1,3,
14,"Modify the test class so that the device spends one minute in walking, two minutes in running, 30 seconds in cycling, and one minute in still state. Does the dashboard fragment show the correct breakdown of activities?",1,3,
/,CODE INSPECTION,,,
15,"SharedPreferences are used for storing activity information, step count, and acceleration intensity.",1,1,
16,ViewBinding (no findViewById) is used for UI interaction (check build.gradle.kts and Fragment classes).,1,1,
17,SettingsFragment uses preferences defined in an XML file.,1,1,
18,Step count is updated periodically.,1,1,
19,History is kept in apropriate SharedPreferences variables.,1,1,
20,History variables are used in the HistoryFragment.,1,1,
/,GENERAL IMPRESSION,,,
